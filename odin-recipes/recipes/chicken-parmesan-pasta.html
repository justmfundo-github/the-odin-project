        <h2>Steps/Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oil and garlic in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until garlic starts to sizzle. Stir in tomatoes, basil, oregano, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cook until sauce slightly thickens and flavors meld, 10 to 12 minutes. Cover and keep warm.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
          <li>To make the chicken cutlets: Lay chicken pieces between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or heavy pan to pound chicken to about 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
          <li>Beat egg in a shallow dish until well blended. Season bread crumbs with black pepper in another shallow dish.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven broiler to high. Place a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source.</li>
          <li>Working with one cutlet at a time, dip chicken in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. Lay breaded cutlets on a wire rack set over a cookie sheet (this step helps breading stay put).</li>
          <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers.</li>
          <li>Fry breaded cutlets in hot oil until golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes. Wash and dry the wire rack and return to the cookie sheet; place fried cutlets on the clean wire rack.</li>
          <li>Top each cutlet with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Broil until cheese melts and is spotty brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Portion pasta onto 4 plates and top each with a chicken cutlet. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons tomato sauce over each cutlet, then sauce pasta as desired. Serve with extra Parmesan at the table.</li>
